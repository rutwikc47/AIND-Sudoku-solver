# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: *Constraint propogation is a technique involving use of local constraints to reduce the problem complexity.
   In the case of Naked Twins problem,the constraints are that the values to be updated are nothing but the intersection of peer sets of the naked twins.
   This reduces our search space to a great extent thus helping us solve the problem*

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: *In the case of Diagonal Sudoku,by using Constraint propogation local constraints are identified which limits our solving space to only the diagonals of our sudoku*
